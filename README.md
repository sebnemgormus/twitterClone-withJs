# Twimba: A Basic Twitter Clone with JavaScript

The purpose of this application is to emulate a number of the features of the real Twitter platform. Among the app's capabilities are the ability to compose and post tweets to a feed, to like or dislike tweets, to retweet or unretweet, and to delete tweets. Additionally, users can access replies to tweets by clicking on the reply icon.
